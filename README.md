# ðŸš€ Asteroids Shooter - Gamedev Engine Room

An evolving space shooter built live on the [Gamedev Engine Room YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@gamedevengineroom). Watch as we transform a simple asteroid blaster into something... more.

## ðŸŽ® The Game

Classic asteroids shooting action with a twist - each workshop adds new features, refactors systems, or explores different Unity development techniques. What starts as a simple spaceship dodging rocks becomes a testbed for game development patterns and practices.

### Current Features

- ðŸ’¥ Satisfying asteroid destruction
- ðŸ“Š Score tracking system
- ðŸŽ¯ And more with each workshop!
